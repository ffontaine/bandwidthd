Lots of ram could be saved by not storing empty send or receive structures in ram
	(Happens when a ip receives packets but does not send them during an interval for example,
	happens alot due to ping scan traffic, broadcast traffic, etc, initial investigations indecate
	this could cut ram usage in direct graphing mode in half)
Config switches for sample intervals and graphing ranges
